Search Engine Test Queries
--------------------------

Below are the test queries used to evaluate the search engine. Comments include initial performance issues and improvements made.

1. "machine learning"
   - Initially, returned too many irrelevant results. Improved by refining the tf-idf scoring and ensuring proper tokenization.

2. "data science"
   - Faced issues with stemming causing mismatched results. Adjusted the stemmer settings to improve accuracy.

3. "python programming"
   - Early tests showed slow response times. Optimized the index reading process to enhance performance.

4. "database systems"
   - Initially had lower recall. Improved by adjusting the ranking algorithm to weigh certain terms more heavily.

5. "artificial intelligence"
   - Initially, relevant documents ranked lower. Improved by refining the scoring algorithm to better account for term importance.

6. "the"
   - Handling of unimportant/irrelevant searches

7. "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"
   - Efficiency of really specific word that will only appear in wordlist.txt

8. "awelkjfh aohiwg mnvcx"
   - Gibberish words that wouldn't appear

9. "uci"
   - Handling of broad word that encompasses the whole list of links
Each query helped identify and address different aspects of the search engine's performance, leading to overall improvements in accuracy and efficiency.
